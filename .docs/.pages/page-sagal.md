# Space Age Galore

A large recipe pack that adds over 90 new recipes to the 110 already present in [Vanilla Galore](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/vanilla_galore_continued). This mod doesn't add new items, fluids, or buildings and can be safely added to a save at any time without causing issues.

**MOD SPOTLIGHT [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpqJSHA4Q5A&lc=Ugw0CpAURsOiowPeeEx4AaABAg)**

## This mod is for you if...

-   You're looking for a recipe mod that introduces many balanced alternate recipes. _(All calculations are documented in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/JTnadrooi/Project-Galore), both in the `docs\` folder and through in-script comments.)_
-   You enjoy upgrading builds to use more efficient, advanced recipes.
-   You want Gleba to be more self-sustaining.
-   You like building megabases.
-   You're looking for something different without using a major overhaul mod.

## This mod is _not_ for you if...

-   You prefer to reuse the same blueprints.
-   You don't like having multiple choices for recipes.

## Full feature list

Im not listing every recipe but these are some of the more notable ones.

-   More recipes for molten iron/copper with varying efficiencies.
-   More bioprocessing recipes, even outside gleba. (And like every alternate recipe, they're _optional!_)
-   More uses for items/fluids like ammonia, holmium solution, carbon fiber, tungsten carbide, etc..
-   More oil processing recipes; Steam cracking, sulfur focussed oil processing, oil centrifuging.
-   Synthetic crude oil from ammonia, carbon and water.
-   Ammonia from bioprocessing, for bioprocessing.
-   More recipes for the centrifuge, it even has fluid ports now!
-   Multiple different ways of creating the planetary sciences.
-   Alternate rocket part recipes.
-   Biochemistry.
-   More module recipes.
-   Organic circuits; They are cheaper but require spoilable materials.
-   More casting recipes. (But none of the ones featured in popular "More casting" mods.)

_I have made sure none of the recipes are objectivelly better than others. No recipes will become UI-clutter after other ones are unlocked as every recipe has their place, all of them._

This is a strength of one massive recipe pack instead of many smaller ones. All recipes are interconnected.

## Recommended mods

-   [Age Of Production](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Age-of-Production) by [AndreusAxolotl](https://mods.factorio.com/user/AndreusAxolotl); Makes it so many of the alternate recipes are made in _brand-new machines_!
-   [Space Age Galore Galore](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/galore-squared) by [engineer-in-a-box](https://mods.factorio.com/user/engineer-in-a-box); A addon that adds _even more recipes_!

## Notes

-   **Recipes can be enabled or disabled in the mod settings. Make sure to review these settings before starting your game.**
-   This mod has no impact on performance. In fact, some recipes are designed specifically to improve performance in megabases.
-   This mod is not made with preventing LDS-shuffle like quality chains in mind.
-   Because of how the recycler works, a circuit made from plastic and copper wire will still recycle down into iron plates and copper wire. Changing this would unfortunately break Fulgora (and existing saves). However, due to the 25% recycler return, this does not disrupt balance, just something to keep in mind.

_And lastly, if you have any (recipe) ideas, please create a discussion thread! New recipe suggestions are highly appreciated. (´∀`)b_
