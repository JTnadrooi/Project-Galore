# Vanilla Galore

Adds **over 110** unique, well-balanced recipes to the base game, with the option to disable specific ones if desired. Vanilla Galore doesn't add any items, fluids, or buildings.

**SPACE AGE SUPPORT [HERE](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/space_age_galore)**

## This mod is for you if...

-   You're looking for a recipe mod that introduces many balanced alternate recipes. _(All calculations are documented in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/JTnadrooi/Project-Galore), both in the `docs\` folder and through in-script comments.)_
-   You enjoy upgrading builds to use more efficient, advanced recipes.
-   You like building megabases.
-   You're looking for something different without using a major overhaul mod.

## This mod is _not_ for you if...

-   You prefer to reuse the same blueprints.
-   You don't like having multiple choices for recipes.

## Notes

-   **Recipes can be enabled or disabled in the mod settings. Make sure to review these settings before starting your game.**
-   This mod has no impact on performance. In fact, some recipes are designed specifically to improve performance in megabases.
