## Angels Galore TODO

A full list of tweaks.

Note:

-   With "normalise" I mean make it so the recipe's ingredients/results don't have amounts like 9, 7 or 84, chances like "50% 3" or "0 to 1". This is just personal preference.
-   With "direct" fluids/items I mean that they only get used for one thing and are made fairly easily (Usually just gas + catalyst or a bit of steam). I do not like these entries and remove most of them. Again, personal preference.
