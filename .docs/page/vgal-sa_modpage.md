# Space Age Galore

A large recipe pack that adds over 50 new recipes to the 80 already present in [Vanilla Galore](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/vanilla_galore_continued). This mod doesn't add new items, fluids, or buildings and can be safely added to a save at any time without causing issues.

## This mod is for you if...

-   You're looking for a recipe mod that introduces many balanced alternate recipes. _(All calculations are documented in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/JTnadrooi/Project-Galore), both in the `docs\` folder and through in-script comments.)_
-   You enjoy upgrading builds to use more efficient, advanced recipes.
-   You want Gleba to be more self-sustaining. - Organic circuits/more! ( ´ཀ` )
-   You like building megabases.
-   You're looking for something different without using a major overhaul mod.

## This mod is _not_ for you if...

-   You prefer to reuse the same blueprints.
-   You don't like having multiple choices for recipes.

## Notes

-   **Recipes can be enabled or disabled in the mod settings. Make sure to review these settings before starting your game.**
-   This mod has no impact on performance. In fact, some recipes are designed specifically to improve performance in megabases.
-   This mod is not made with preventing LDS-shuffle like quality chains in mind.
-   Because of how the recycler works, a circuit made from plastic and copper wire will still recycle down into iron plates and copper wire. Changing this would unfortunately break Fulgora (and existing saves). However, due to the 25% recycler return, this does not disrupt balance, just something to keep in mind. I highly recommend using mods like [Upcycler](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/upcycler).
-   If you play with this mod, I would greatly appreciate it if you could share gameplay screenshots for the mod page. It would be awesome to showcase how players are using my mod :)

_And lastly, if you have any recipe ideas, please create a discussion thread! New recipe suggestions are highly appreciated. (´∀`)b_

Thanks for playing!
