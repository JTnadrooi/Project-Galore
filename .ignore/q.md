# How much is a plastic bar worth?

I'm making a mod containing ~200 recipes and for general balancing guidelines I'm creating a spreadsheet of all items and their worth. For everything that is not oil or uranium this was as straightforward as giving all ores (+coal & stone) a value and going from there, but for oil however this has proven to be a bit more tricky. After trying a bunch of methods to calculate the value of a plastic bar (fuel potency of materials, power cost/item, production space needed for one belt, time of unlock) I have opted to just asking and compiling all your opinions and answers to an eventual value.

-   I will be perfectly content with answers as "Slightly more than an iron plate" but as small reference; (all ores except uranium)=10;steel=50;electronic-circuit=25; etc...
-   This is for basegame, without the DLC.

### Vanilla Galore

A WIP mod that adds alternate recipes galore. (This is the intermediates tab, not balanced around space age _yet_.) Coming soon! :D
