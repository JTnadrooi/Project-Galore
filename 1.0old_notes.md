greenhouse is 0.5 wood per second (avg), pumpjack is say; 12.5 oil per second.
to make 8 greenhouses equal 1 125% pumpjack 1 wood needs to be worth 3.125 oil.

8\*0.5x = 12.5
4x = 12.5
x = 3.125 = 1 wood

1 wood = 3.125 oil = 3.046875 pg = 1.9921875 lo (~2\*) = 10 bio vapor =
1 wood = 10 bio vapor

1 oil = 0.975 pg
1 oil = 0.6375 lo
1 oil = 0.25 ho

1 greenhouse = 0.5 wood per second (simple) = 1.5234375 pg/s
1 greenhouse = 12.5% of a 125% pumpjack
1 yellow belt is 30 greenhouses

adv oil processing = 19.5 pg/s
adv oil processing = 12.75 lo/s
adv oil processing = 5 ho/s

0.5 m/s (minerals per second)
50 sa/s (wow!)

ho to lo ratio = 0.75
oil to pg ratio = 0.975
oil to lo ratio = 0.34
oil to bio vapor = 3.2

bio vapor to lo = 0.10625

coal liquefaction processing = 11.2 pg/s
basic oil processing = 9 pg/s

1 coal = 5.6 pg = 6.5 ho = 2 lo = 5.74 oil = 1.842 wood = wrong
1 125% pumpjack = 12.1875 pg/s
1 coal miner = 2.8 pg/s = 22.97% of a 125% pumpjack

1 solid fuel (lo, ignoring pg) = 29.4 oil
1 solid fuel (adv, pg) = 10.3 oil = 33 bio vapor

1 rocket fuel = 110 lo = 323 oil = 1035 bio vapor => /1.4\* => 739 = ~740 bio vapor = 74 wood.. eh.. seems kinda expensive but hey, rockets fuel doesn't grow on trees.

coal is 1.8368 times as oil potent as wood; I like that.

\*Oh the benevolence! I rounded it up. I also shall grant whoever uses the wood to light oil recipes a multiplier of (1 + 5 / 12.75) = ~1.4

order: vanilla-galore << angels galore (+apm) << pyanodon galore (raw ores + coal + maybe petroleum handling) << GALORE
order2: vanilla-galore << krastorio galore (+248k) << galore
order3?: vanilla-galore << yuogi galore << GALORE -- semi-cancelled: Yuoki sprites are amazing but kind of broken looking at pipe connections.
order4: proper tier doubling plus << GALORE -- will just be highly recommended.
order5: vanilla-galore << bitumen << GALORE -- cancelled: I do like many of the items and minables bitumen adds but still... its basically "we have angels at home"... sorry
order6: BZ << trikop << GALORE -- alot of ores but I think im starting to like that..
order6: Extended vanilla refining + Molten Metals << GALORE -- Can't wait for the 900% productivity iron/copper refining chains...

cancelled-before-production: space-exploration << GALORE -- I personally do not like space exploration
cancelled-before-production: bobs-plates << GALORE -- Then I should just do Angels INDUSTRIES Galore...
cancelled-before-production: exotic-industries << GALORE -- A bit to large of a mod, thats why I will probably be doing 248k instead.
