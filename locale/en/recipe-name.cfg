[recipe-description]
vgal-analog-circuit=Analog circuits rely on mechanical contraptions rather than conventional electrical logic, and they are interchangeable.

vgal-battery-engine-unit=Replace a bit of steel with a battery and a small generator, and now its a hybrid. Splendid.

vgal-engine-unit-rocket-part=A primitive and highly polluting rocket part—best suited for those who really value that dieselpunk aesthetic
vgal-solar-panel-rocket-part=Solar isn't quite as efficient in an atmosphere. Maybe the second stage is eco-friendly.
vgal-uranium-fuel-cell-rocket-part=Highly efficient rocket parts—just don't nuke the moon... Project A119, anyone?
vgal-flying-robot-frame-rocket-part=Why build a single rocket when a swarm of bots can carry your payload to orbit?
