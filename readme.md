## Todo

-   (Add) More inline circuit recipes.
-   Military science recipes.
-   Setting: Dissable recipe group X. _(Recipe groups below)_
    -   _Analog circuits:_ Circuit recipes using some sort of mechanical ingredients.
    -   _Rocket parts:_ Alternate rocket part recipes.
    -   _Science packs:_ Alternate science recipes.
    -   _Centrifuging:_ Recipes using a electric-engine-unit as "tool". They all have in common the electric engine unit has a small chance to be returned. **_(Recipes yet to be implemented)_**
    -   _Oil:_ Alternate oil processing recipes. **_(Recipes yet to be implemented)_**
    -   _Far fetched:_ Recipes that may be a bit far fetched. I have a recipe planned that takes in one space science and returns a random amount of any science pack below it. This is an example of a far fetched recipe. **_(Recipes yet to be implemented)_**
    -   _Wood:_ Recipes using (or creating) wood. **_(Recipes yet to be implemented)_**
-   The production tab.
    -   Add multiple tiers of building production. (Normal(vanilla) - Steel - Electric engine/lds) _Note: This is done for belt mall users. It should stay possible to put any mix of ingredients on a couple on a belt and let a few mall assemblers leach from it._
-   The combat tab.
-   The logistics tab.
-   Alternate uranium recipes.
