# Project Galore

A collection of mods focused on adding more recipes to the base game and Space Age.

## Current Installations

-   **[Vanilla Galore](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/vanilla_galore_continued)** – _(The core of the project)_ Adds a large amount of new recipes to the vanilla game.
-   **[Space Age Galore](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/space_age_galore)** – Support for Space Age, and introduces another 50+ additional recipes.

## Suggestions

Until this gains enough traction for me to create a Discord server, please create a discussion thread on the modpage of the designied Galore entry if you have any recipe suggestions.
